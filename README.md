# React store

## MVP:

### 2 pages:
- Home Page
- Grid of products
- Carousel of featured products
- Product Page (with id parameter) Similar to a product page on another site, allows you to add to cart and select product variants

All products should be stored in Firestore, you should store the following information:
- quantity
- variants (could be colors, sizes, etc)
- price per unit
- name
- image url
- favourited or not (boolean)

All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by the frontend, there should be NO static product data in the react application
